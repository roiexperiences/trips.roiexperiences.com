Welcome to Kualoa Ranch! A place of extraordinary beauty, preserved through the stewardship of the Morgan family, who acquired the initial ranch lands from King Kamehameha III in 1850. Kualoa Ranch is Oahu's largest and oldest cattle ranch and the site of its first sugar mill. The ranch terrain varies from dense rainforest to broad open valleys and from beautiful white sand beaches to verdant cliff faces. It is truly a paradise for outdoor recreation with many places accessible only by horseback, on an all-terrain vehicle or by hiking. Ancient Hawaiians considered Kualoa one of the most sacred places on Oahu and today the ranch will be yours to explore and play! <br><br><br>
