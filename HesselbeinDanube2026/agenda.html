The capital of Hungary- Budapest – is where we start our journey. Before setting off you will have the opportunity to stroll the streets and see for yourself why this is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe. History lovers will be entranced by the fascinating and eye-opening aspects of this city. The people are friendly and unusually eager to share their home with all. 
<br><br>
Once sailing, the first stop is Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia – a city steeped in history. You’ll feel you are in a fairy tale as you stroll the cobblestone streets of the medieval Old Town and take a step back in time.  Wander by St. Martin’s Cathedral, the famous St. Michael’s Gate and don’t miss the opportunity to see Bratislava Castle., with its sweeping views of the city and the Danube. Have a coffee and watch the world go by in what many say is the hidden gem of the former Austral-Hungarian Empire.
<br><br>
Next, we make our way to Vienna - Austria’s capital and the world capital of music. For centuries, Vienna has been the destination for lovers of culture around the world. You will have the opportunity to see St. Stephen’s Cathedral, the Vienna Opera House, the Imperial Palace and so much more. Any traveler (experienced or new) lists Vienna as a top destination - find yourself immersed and charmed by this amazing city.
<br><br>
Continuing on to Krems, one of the oldest towns in Austria. Widely acknowledged in 995 AD, there are examples of it as a settlement more than 25,000 years before even that. Despite at one time being almost as cosmopolitan as Vienna, today it seems untouched by the modern world. Be sure to try their Marillenschnaps – an apricot brandy that the town is famous for!
<br><br>
As we make our way to Linz, we will go through the scenic Wachau Valley including Mauthasen & Ybbs. With its charming villages, pastoral hills and valleys, wineries and historical sites such as the 9th century St. Florian Monastery, the Wachau Valley is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. And also, one of the leading producers of Reisling wines.
<br><br>
Our last stop in Austria is Linz. The beginnings of Linz date back to the first century and the settlement known officially as “Linz” was documented in 799 AD. Architectural buffs will be drawn to the amazing Baroque style covering most of the city as well as the neo-Gothic New Cathedral which is the largest church in Austria.  Dessert lovers will want to try the city’s famous pastry known as a Linzer Torte. You will leave Linz wanting more.
<br><br>
Finally, we will make our last overnight cruise to Vilshofen, Germany where we will disembark to begin our journey home. The Danube is one of the most famous and beautiful rivers in the world and having had the chance to explore it for yourself, you will understand why.
