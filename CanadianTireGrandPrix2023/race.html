            The Gilles Villeneuve circuit in Montreal sits on a charming man-made island on the Saint Lawrence river in Quebec, a 
      venue celebrated for its dramatic racing, and the fantastic atmosphere in and around the paddock.<br><br>
 
Winding its way around the islandâ€™s parkland, the circuit is as treacherous as it is varied, with high speed straights mixed with 
very low speed corners, with unforgiving barriers never far away.<br><br>
 
This exhilarating circuit benefits from the cosmopolitan, urban buzz of Montreal, a vibrant city which fully embraces the Grand Prix, 
creating a truly exceptional atmosphere, making this a real favourite with fans. <BR><br>
