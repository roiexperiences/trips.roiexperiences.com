<strong>Coco Bay<br>
</strong>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><font face="Arial" color="#ffffff">

Enjoy the day at Royal Caribbean's private island destination in The Bahamas! You'll be amazed at all there is to do in this 120-acre piece of paradise. Whether you are an adrenaline junkie or just looking to lay on the sandy beaches and relax with a cold drink, this is where you want to be. There are 13 waterslides to appeal to the daredevil in you as well as a helium ballon ride and zipline. The island boasts the largest freshwater pool in the Caribbean with plenty of spots available to take in your own little piece of paradise. There is no shortage of venues for you to grab a light snack or a full meal. Your beverage package also works here so be sure to quench your thirst with whatever appeals to you that day.
When preparing for the day, be sure to bring:<br><br>
<li>SeaPass: this is your ID, room key and "credit card". It identifies you as part of the Royal Caribbean family.
<li>Beach Towels: There are plenty on the ship, so grab few so you can take advantage of all the fun to be had.
<li>Sunscreen: You'll want to protect yourself from a full day of fun in the sun!
<li>Closed-toes shoes: Attire throughout Coco Cay is casual and relaxed, but if you want to try the zipline, these are a requirement.
<li>Wallet: Although your SeaPass will cover almost anything available through Royal Caribbean, sometimes you see something extra that catches your eye and you have to have it.  You'll encounter private vendors with lots of options for souvenirs and treats and they may only take cash or credit cards. So don't miss out on any opportunities.
Coco Cay is the ultimate way to relax in The Bahamas and its waiting for you!

The day will fly by and you’ll be left wanting more. Just another reason you'll love it in Naussau.
